The following Python script can encrypt any hexadecimal string into another hexadecimal string, using a secret key.
When the flag and original key was in the script, it output this:

cd d3 c8 ce e2 d9 d6 db c8 db d0 d5 ce c6 ca d0 d7 cf cc d9 da c6 c8 d9 cc c6 cc c8 da e0 c6 db d6 c6 c9 d9 dc db cc c6 cd d6 d9 ca cc e4
f  l  a  g  {           a           g                             a              a                                         f
Can you recover what the original input was?

Starting hints:
- The real flag should start with "flag{". What is that in hex?
- You can run Python scripts online here https://replit.com/languages/python3 or download it here https://www.python.org/downloads/
-- If you are on any modern Linux distro, chances are you already have python3 installed and can run the script like this: `python3 rotate_256.py`
